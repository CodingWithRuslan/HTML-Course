HTML Course :
  1 - Introduction : HTML might not be the most exciting topic in computer science, but it lies at the heart of web development and is requisite knowledge for any frontend engineer.
  2 - HTML Basics : In order to build a solid foundation, we need to start with some basics. Let's begin!
  3 - Semantic HTML : If a human being were to read your markup code without any accompanying visual representation, would they still have a clear understanding of the general structure of your page?
  4 - Essential HTML Tags : More common than the common housefly, these HTML tags are virtually ubiquitous and can be found populating nearly every webpage.
