HTML Course :

  1 - Introduction : 
  HTML might not be the most exciting topic in computer science,
  but it lies at the heart of web development and is requisite knowledge for any frontend engineer.
  
  2 - HTML Basics : 
  In order to build a solid foundation, we need to start with some basics. Let's begin!
  
  3 - Semantic HTML : 
  If a human being were to read your markup code without any accompanying visual representation, 
  would they still have a clear understanding of the general structure of your page?
  
  4 - Essential HTML Tags : 
  More common than the common housefly,
  these HTML tags are virtually ubiquitous and can be found populating nearly every webpage.
  
  5 - Tables :
  Tables are best used to organize your page layout! 
  Just kidding. Please don't ever use table layouts. This isn't 1996.

  6 - Forms :
  It is often joked that frontend developers spend most of their time just editing buttons on forms. 
  Theoretically though, if this turned out to be true, wouldn't it behoove you to ensure you knew your way around forms?


  7 - Document Object Model :
  Ah, the Document Object Model. A term that you've heard many times before, that feels intimately familiar, yet that you couldn't define if your life—or your frontend interview—depended on it. Let's change that.
  
  8 - Accessibility
    Accessible web development leads to a better user experience for all and, ultimately, to a more inclusive internet. In that spirit, let us look at some       of the best practices to follow and some markup elements to include when designing with accessibility in mind.
    
  9 - Meta Tags
      Metadata is special information about your webpage that can be used by search engines and web browsers to do cool stuff. 
      But where do you define this data?
