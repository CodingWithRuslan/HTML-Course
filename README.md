HTML Course :

  1 - Introduction : 
  HTML might not be the most exciting topic in computer science,
  but it lies at the heart of web development and is requisite knowledge for any frontend engineer.
  
  2 - HTML Basics : 
  In order to build a solid foundation, we need to start with some basics. Let's begin!
  
  3 - Semantic HTML : 
  If a human being were to read your markup code without any accompanying visual representation, 
  would they still have a clear understanding of the general structure of your page?
  
  4 - Essential HTML Tags : 
  More common than the common housefly,
  these HTML tags are virtually ubiquitous and can be found populating nearly every webpage.
  
  5 - Tables :
  Tables are best used to organize your page layout! 
  Just kidding. Please don't ever use table layouts. This isn't 1996.

  6 - Forms :
  It is often joked that frontend developers spend most of their time just editing buttons on forms. 
  Theoretically though, if this turned out to be true, wouldn't it behoove you to ensure you knew your way around forms?
